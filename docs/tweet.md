[Guide](/index.md) ðŸ¢’ **Tweet your code**

Our Twitter bot is coming soon! In the meantime, feel free to post random Tweets about atto. Not that anyone will be able to easily run your code!

<div class="tweetableCode"></div>

Your Tweet will be <strong class="tweetableCodeSize">---</strong> characters long.

<button onclick="startTweetIntent();">Tweet</button>

We plan to make our Twitter account at <a href="https://twitter.com/codeurdreams" target="_blank">@codeurdreams</a> reply to any BASIC code replied/mentioned to it with a live demonstration photo/video of the code running, which will allow you to showcase your code!
